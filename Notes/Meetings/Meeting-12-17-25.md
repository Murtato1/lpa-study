# 12/17/25 Meeting with Ou and Lance

### General: 
* Might be branching out from lwfa:
* Liquid target accelerators
    * Imaging, space radiation testing
* Foundation models applied to topic that is agnostic to trend shifts

### PhD Topic:
* Ou has project to design radiation testing beamline and design control system
* Lasers are fine but data acquisition and diagnostics dont make enough data
* Computationally oriented rather than hardware oriented
* Lance idea: think of wakefield acceleration as a scattering problem
* Dont have a sufficient tool set to integrate the whole picture of the scattering problem on this mm length scale
* More interesting to develop a foundation model physics informed model with simulations to solve the scattering problem
 Start from coarse model and work up to finer model


# Todo:

* Read through PIC code and literature


### Implement:
Chain of thought down the line
